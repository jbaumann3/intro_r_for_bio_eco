    "text": "If you are here you are likely learning R and RStudio or you are teaching R and RStudio. Thanks for being here. I hope you find these resources helpful.\n\n\n\nThe materials on this website have been designed for use in teaching R to undergraduate students who range in experience from never using R (or any programming language before) to beginner and intermediate R users. I have designed these resources for use in my 200 level Biostatistics course, 300 level Biology electives, and to teach my research students how to use R. That said, anyone who is trying to learn R (or learning how to teach R) may find these tutorials and excerises useful.\n\n\n\n\nNavigate using the navbar at the top of the page. You can find specific tutorials using the drop down menus. Tutorial content is organized by section. If you are looking for exercises to do yourself (assignments, challenges, etc), you can find those in the “exercises” drop down menu in the navbar. These are downloadable .qmd files that you can open in your own instance of R and modify!\n\n\n\nYou can visit my professional website, github, and twitter pages. You can also email me with questions, comments, and suggestions.\n…"

You can also set a google drive, box, dropbox, or other shared folder as your working directory if you’d like (as long as you are syncing a folder between the cloud and your computer – ASK me if you have questions about this!) b.) Once you navigate to a directory you still need to SET IT as your working directory. You do this in the “More” cog– select “Set as working directory”\n2.) Set working directory with code: We use the ‘setwd()’ function for this\n\nsetwd(\"C:/Users/Justin Baumann/Desktop/r_for_bioeco\")\n\nNote that I am using rstudio.mtholyoke.edu, a cloud version of RStudio. As such, my setwd() looks weird! ‘~’ just tells R I want to look in the same parent directory I am currently working in. Your version of this might be setwd(“C://username/biol234/code”) or similar. You use a “/” between each folder. As always, ask questions if you have them! The manual setting using “Files” is usually easier for most people."

    "text": "Installing and Loading libraries\nLibraries are packages of functions (and sometimes data) that we use to execute tasks in R. Packages are what make R so versatile! We can do almost anything with R if we learn how to utilize the right packages.\nIf we do not have a package already installed (for example, if you have only just downloaded R/ RStudio), we will need to use install.packages(‘packagename’) to install each package that we need.\n\ninstall.packages(tidyverse)\n\nOR - We can use the ‘Packages’ tab in the bottom right quadrant to install packages. Simply navigate to ‘Packages’, select ‘install packages’ and enter the package names you need (separate each package by commas). NOTE for users for rstudio.mtholyoke.edu – You cannot install packages to the Mt Holyoke cloud instance of R. If we need something that isn’t installed we will need to contact IT!\nIn order for a package to work, we must first load it! We do this as with the code libary(packagename)\n\nlibrary(tidyverse) #for data manipulation\nlibrary(palmerpenguins) #for some fun data!\n\nIt is best practice to load all of the packages you will need at the top of your script\nIn this course we will be following a best practices guide that utilizes a library called ‘Tidyverse’ for data manipulation and analysis. Tidyverse contains many packages all in one, including the very functional ‘dplyr’ and ‘ggplot2’ packages. You will almost always use Tidyverse, so make sure to load it in :)\nNote the ‘#’ with notes after them in the code chunk above. These are called comments. You can comment out any line of code in R by using a ‘#’. This is strongly recommended when you are programming. We will discuss more later!"

It is a ‘smarter’ version of read.csv and can automatically figure out what kind of data (numeric, factor, date, etc) each column is.

You may have a look at papers you have recently read or graphs you find in textbooks or assignments. Consider what you like or don’t like about these graphs. What looks good and/or makes a graph easy to interpret? What doesn’t? Making figures is both an art and a science.\nTo learn more about what makes graphs good (or bad), read Chapter 1 of Kieran Healy’s online data visualization book –&gt; What makes figures bad?\n\nTo continue your learning, have a look at this more detailed data visualization book by Claus Wilke Fundamentals of Data Visualization\n\n# 2: Let’s make some graphs!\nMaking nice looking graphs is a key feature of R and of data science in general. The best way to do this in R is through use of the ggplot2 package. This package is the most user friendly and flexible way to make nice plots in R. Notably, ggplot2 is a package that is contained within the tidyverse package, which is more of a style of R usage than a package. So, let’s load tidyverse and a few other useful packages for today.\n\n#Load packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.2 ──\n✔ ggplot2 3.4.0      ✔ purrr   1.0.0 \n✔ tibble  3.1.8      ✔ dplyr   1.0.10\n✔ tidyr   1.2.1      ✔ stringr 1.5.0 \n✔ readr   2.1.3      ✔ forcats 0.5.2 \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\n\nlibrary(ggsci) #for easy color scales\nlibrary(patchwork) #to make multi-panel plots \nlibrary(palmerpenguins) # our fave penguin friends :)\n\n\n\n3: ggplot basics\n\nIntroductionggplot()histogramboxplotbar graphline graphscatter plotAdding error bars\n\n\nggplot2 is the preferred graphics package for most R users. It allows users to build a graph piece by piece from your own data through mapping of aesthetics. It is much easier to make pretty (publication and presentation quality) plots with ggplot2 than it is with the base plot function in R. If you prefer base plot() that is ok. You can use whatever you’d like but when we talk about graphs we will be using the language of ggplot.\nAttached here are the Tidyverse Cheat Sheets for ggplot2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ggplot() function is the base of the ggplot2 package. Using it creates the space that we use to build a graph. If we run just the ggplot() function we will get a gray rectangle. This is the space (and background) of our plot!\n\nggplot()\n\n\n\n\nTo build a plot on the background, we must add to the ggplot call. First, we need to tell it what data to use. Next, we need to tell it where in the data frame to pull data from to build the axes and data points. The part of the ggplot() function we use to build a graph is called aes() or aesthetics.\nHere is an example using penguins: I am telling ggplot that the data we are using is ‘penguins’ and then defining the x and y axis in the aes() call with column names from penguins\n\nhead(penguins)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 8\n  species island    bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_l…¹ body_…² sex    year\n  &lt;fct&gt;   &lt;fct&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;int&gt;   &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1 Adelie  Torgersen           39.1          18.7         181    3750 male   2007\n2 Adelie  Torgersen           39.5          17.4         186    3800 fema…  2007\n3 Adelie  Torgersen           40.3          18           195    3250 fema…  2007\n4 Adelie  Torgersen           NA            NA            NA      NA &lt;NA&gt;   2007\n5 Adelie  Torgersen           36.7          19.3         193    3450 fema…  2007\n6 Adelie  Torgersen           39.3          20.6         190    3650 male   2007\n# … with abbreviated variable names ¹​flipper_length_mm, ²​body_mass_g\n\nggplot(data=penguins, aes(x=species, y= bill_length_mm)) \n\n\n\n\nLike anything in R, we can give our plot a name and call it later\n\nplot1&lt;-ggplot(data=penguins, aes(x=species, y= bill_length_mm)) \n\nplot1\n\n\n\n\nThis is incredibly useful in ggplot as we can essentially add pieces to make a more complete graph\n\nplot1+\n  geom_boxplot()+\n  geom_point()+\n  theme_bw()\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_boxplot()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we get too excited about making perfect graphs, let’s take a look at the types of graphs we have available to us…\n\n\n\nHistograms are used to explore the frequency distribution of a single variable. We can check for normality (a bell curve) using this feature. We can also look for means, skewed data, and other trends.\n\nggplot(data=penguins, aes(bill_length_mm))+\n  geom_histogram()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_bin()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin geom_histogram we can use bin_width to change the width of our x-axis groupings.\n\nggplot(data=penguins, aes(bill_length_mm))+\n  geom_histogram(binwidth=5)\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_bin()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA boxplot is a really useful plot to assess median and range of data. It can also identify outliers! The defaults for a boxplot in ggplot produce a median and interquartile range (IQR). The 1st quartile is the bottom of the box and the 3rd quartile is the top. The whiskers show the spread of the data where the ends of the whiskers represent the data points that are the furthest from the median in either direction. Notably, if a data point is 1.5 * IQR from the box (either the 1st or 3rd quartile) it is an outlier. Outliers are excluded from whiskers and are presented as points. There\nHere’s an example\n\nggplot(data=penguins, aes(x=species, y= bill_length_mm)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_boxplot()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can use geom_violin to combine boxplot with a density plot (similar to a histogram) Here we can see the distribution of values within bill length by species.\n\nggplot(data=penguins, aes(x=species, y= bill_length_mm)) +\n  #geom_boxplot()+\n  geom_violin()\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_ydensity()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can make bar graphs in ggplot using geom_bar(). There are some tricks to getting bar graphs to work exactly right, which I will try to detail below. NOTE Bar graphs are very rarely useful. If we want to show means, why not just use points + error bars? What does the bar actually represent? There aren’t that many cases where we really need bar graphs. There are exceptions, like when we have a population and we want to see the demographics of that population by count or percentage (see example below)\nHere is a simple bar chart.\n\nggplot(data=penguins, aes(species)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\nHere is a more elaborate boxplot that shows species breakdown by island! Note that we use an aes() call within geom_bar to define a fill. That means fill by species, or add a color for each species.\n\nggplot(data=penguins, aes(island)) +\n  geom_bar(aes(fill=species))\n\n\n\n\nAnd here is that same plot with the bars unstacked. Instead of stacking, we have used “dodged” each color to be its own bar.\n\nggplot(data=penguins, aes(island)) +\n  geom_bar(aes(fill=species), position= position_dodge())\n\n\n\n\nWe learned when the best (only) times to use bar graphs are. Do you remember what those were? Are the examples above representative of that?\n\n\n\nA line graph can be extremely useful, especially if we are looking at time series data or rates!\nHere is an example of CO2 uptake vs concentration in plants. Each color represents a different plant. NOTE: the dataset called ‘CO2’ is built into R, so we can just use it without loading anything :)\n\nhead(CO2)\n\n  Plant   Type  Treatment conc uptake\n1   Qn1 Quebec nonchilled   95   16.0\n2   Qn1 Quebec nonchilled  175   30.4\n3   Qn1 Quebec nonchilled  250   34.8\n4   Qn1 Quebec nonchilled  350   37.2\n5   Qn1 Quebec nonchilled  500   35.3\n6   Qn1 Quebec nonchilled  675   39.2\n\nggplot(data=CO2, aes(x=conc, y= uptake, color=Plant)) +\n  geom_line()\n\n\n\n\nWe can change the aesthetics of the lines using color, linetype, size, etc. Here I am changing the linetype based on the plant species and increasing the size of ALL lines to 2. This is a good example of how aes() works. Anything within the aes() call is conditional. That means, I give it a name (such as a column or variable name) and it changes based on that column or variable. To change an aesthetic across all lines, points, etc, I just put the code outside of the aes(). As I did for size. That makes the size of ALL lines = 2.\n\nggplot(data=CO2, aes(x=conc, y= uptake, color=Plant)) +\n  geom_line(aes(linetype=Plant),size=2)\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scatter plot is probably the most commonly used graphical tool in ggplot. It is based on the geom_point() function\n\nggplot(data=penguins, aes(x=species, y= bill_length_mm)) +\n  geom_point()\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantly, we can use the data= and aes() calls within geom_point() or any other geom instead of within ggplot() if needed. Why might this be important?\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=penguins, aes(x=species, y= bill_length_mm))\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes we don’t want to plot all of our points on the same vertical line. If that is the case, we can use geom_jitter()\n\nggplot(data=penguins, aes(x=species, y= bill_length_mm)) +\n  geom_jitter()\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe often want to present means and error in our visualizations. This can be done through the use of geom_boxplot() or through combining geom_point() with geom_errorbar()\nHere is an example of the later…\n\n#First, we need to calculate a mean bill length for our penguins by species and island\nsumpens&lt;- penguins %&gt;%\n  group_by(species, island) %&gt;%\n  na.omit() %&gt;% #removes rows with NA values (a few rows may otherwise have NA due to sampling error in the field)\n  summarize(meanbill=mean(bill_length_mm), sd=sd(bill_length_mm), n=n(), se=sd/sqrt(n))\n\nsumpens\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 6\n# Groups:   species [3]\n  species   island    meanbill    sd     n    se\n  &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;fct&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie    Biscoe        39.0  2.48    44 0.374\n2 Adelie    Dream         38.5  2.48    55 0.335\n3 Adelie    Torgersen     39.0  3.03    47 0.442\n4 Chinstrap Dream         48.8  3.34    68 0.405\n5 Gentoo    Biscoe        47.6  3.11   119 0.285\n\n# Now we can plot! \nggplot(data=sumpens, aes(x=species, y=meanbill, color=island))+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_errorbar(data=sumpens, aes(x=species, ymin=meanbill-se, ymax=meanbill+se), width=0.2)\n\n\n\n\nAnd if we want to be extra fancy (and rigorous), we can plot the raw data behind the mean+error This is considered a graphical best practice as we can see the mean, error, and the true spread of the data!\n\nggplot()+\n  geom_jitter(data= penguins, aes(x=species, y=bill_length_mm, color=island), alpha=0.5, width=0.2)+ #this is the raw data\n  geom_point(data=sumpens, aes(x=species, y=meanbill, color=island), size=3)+ #this is the averages\n  geom_errorbar(data=sumpens, aes(x=species, ymin=meanbill-se, ymax=meanbill+se), width=0.1)\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nAn alternative to geom_jitter, which doesn’t always work, is to use geom_point but force the points to not overlap with position_dodge.

    "text": "The Tidyverse is a collection of R packages that can be used together for many different data science practices. They share syntax and are very versatile. For most users, the Tidyverse provides a structure of “best practices” that will allow a user to do just about anything with data.\nWe can load the Tidyverse as a single package in R:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.2 ──\n✔ ggplot2 3.4.0      ✔ purrr   1.0.0 \n✔ tibble  3.1.8      ✔ dplyr   1.0.10\n✔ tidyr   1.2.1      ✔ stringr 1.5.0 \n✔ readr   2.1.3      ✔ forcats 0.5.2 \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\n\n\nThe tidyverse package contains the following packages: 1.) ggplot2: the best graphing package in R\n2.) dplyr: most of our data wrangling tools come from here\n3.) tidyr: tools for data tidying (cleaning, reshaping)\n4.) readr: tools for reading in different types of data – this is where the read_csv() function comes from\n5.) purrr: tools for working with functions and vectors (useful but likely not right away for beginners)\n6.) stringr: functions to help us work with strings (like sentences, paragraphs, lists, etc)\n7.) forcats: “for categories” - makes working with factors (categorical data) easier!\nLearn more about the Tidyverse\nThis section contains some worked examples of Tidyverse best practices for data manipulation. If you just want a quick refresher, you can take a look at the cheat sheet below!\n\n\n\n\nWe can mess with a few data sets that are built into R or into R packages.\nA common one is mtcars, which is part of base R (attributes of a bunch of cars)\n\nhead(mtcars)\n\n                   mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb\nMazda RX4         21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4\nMazda RX4 Wag     21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4\nDatsun 710        22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1\nHornet 4 Drive    21.4   6  258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1\nHornet Sportabout 18.7   8  360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02  0  0    3    2\nValiant           18.1   6  225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1\n\n\nAnother fun one is CO2, which is also part of base R (CO2 uptake from different plants).

We can select those columns to keep and remove the rest of the columns because they are just clutter at this point. There are two ways we can do this: 1.) Select the columns we want to keep 2.) Select the columns we want to remove\nHere are two ways to do that:\nBase R example For those with some coding experience you may like this method as this syntax is common in other coding languages\nStep 1.) Count the column numbers. Column 1 is the left most column. Remember we can use ncol() to count the total number of columns (useful when we have a huge number of columns)\n\nncol(penguins) # we have 8 columns\n\n[1] 8\n\n\nSpecies is column 1 and bill length is column 3. Those are the only columns we want!\nStep 2.) Select columns we want to keep using bracket syntax. Here we wil use this basic syntax: df[rows, columns] We can input the rows and/or columns we want inside our brackets. If we want more than 1 row or column we will need to use a ‘c()’ for concatenate (combine). To select just species and bill length we would do the following:\n\nhead(penguins[,c(1,3)]) #Selecting NO specific rows and 2 columns (numbers 1 and 3)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  species bill_length_mm\n  &lt;fct&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie            39.1\n2 Adelie            39.5\n3 Adelie            40.3\n4 Adelie            NA  \n5 Adelie            36.7\n6 Adelie            39.3\n\n\nIMPORTANT When we do this kind of manipulation it is super helpful to NAME the output. In the above example I didn’t do that. If I don’t name the output I cannot easily call it later. If I do name it, I can use it later and see it in my ‘Environment’ tab. So, I should do this:\n\npens&lt;-penguins[,c(1,3)]\nhead(pens)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  species bill_length_mm\n  &lt;fct&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie            39.1\n2 Adelie            39.5\n3 Adelie            40.3\n4 Adelie            NA  \n5 Adelie            36.7\n6 Adelie            39.3\n\n\nNow, here’s how you do the same selection step by removing the columns you DO NOT want.\n\npens2&lt;-penguins[,-c(2,4:8)] #NOTE that ':' is just shorthand for all columns between 4 and 8. I could also use -c(2,4,5,6,7,8)\nhead(pens2)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  species bill_length_mm\n  &lt;fct&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie            39.1\n2 Adelie            39.5\n3 Adelie            40.3\n4 Adelie            NA  \n5 Adelie            36.7\n6 Adelie            39.3\n\n\n\nTidyverse example (select())\nPerhaps that example above was a little confusing? This is why we like Tidyverse! We can do the same thing using the select() function in Tidyverse and it is easier!\nI still want just species and bill length. Here’s how I select them:\n\nhead(select(penguins, species, bill_length_mm))\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  species bill_length_mm\n  &lt;fct&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie            39.1\n2 Adelie            39.5\n3 Adelie            40.3\n4 Adelie            NA  \n5 Adelie            36.7\n6 Adelie            39.3\n\n\nEASY. Don’t forget to name the output for use later :)\nLike this:\n\nshortpen&lt;-select(penguins, species, bill_length_mm)\nhead(shortpen)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  species bill_length_mm\n  &lt;fct&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie            39.1\n2 Adelie            39.5\n3 Adelie            40.3\n4 Adelie            NA  \n5 Adelie            36.7\n6 Adelie            39.3"

    "text": "Pivot data (wide to long / long to wide)\n‘Pivoting’ data means changing the format of the data. Tidyverse and ggplot in particular tend to like data in ‘long’ format. Long format means few columns and many rows. Wide format is the opposite- many columns and fewer rows.\nWide format is usually how the human brain organizes data. For example, a spreadsheet in which every species is in its own column is wide format. You might take this sheet to the field and record present/absence or count of each species at each site or something. This is great but it might be easier for us to calculate averages or do group based analysis in R if we have a column called ‘species’ in which every single species observation is a row. This leads to A LOT of repeated categorical variables (site, date, etc), which is fine.\nExample of Long Format The built in dataset ‘fish_encounters’ is a simple example of long format data. Penguins, iris, and others are also in long format but are more complex\n\nhead(fish_encounters) # here we see 3 columns that track each fish (column 1) across MANY stations (column 2) \n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  fish  station  seen\n  &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt;   &lt;int&gt;\n1 4842  Release     1\n2 4842  I80_1       1\n3 4842  Lisbon      1\n4 4842  Rstr        1\n5 4842  Base_TD     1\n6 4842  BCE         1\n\n\nConverting from long to wide using pivot_wider (Tidyverse) Although we know that long format is preferred for working in Tidyverse and doing graphing and data analysis in R, we sometimes do want data to be in wide format. There are certain functions and operations that may require wide format. This is also the format that we are most likely to use in the field. So, let’s convert fish_encounters back to what it likely was when the data were recorded in the field…\n\n#penguins long to wide using pivot_wider\n\nwidefish&lt;-fish_encounters %&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(names_from= station, values_from = seen)\n\nhead(widefish)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 12\n  fish  Release I80_1 Lisbon  Rstr Base_TD   BCE   BCW  BCE2  BCW2   MAE   MAW\n  &lt;fct&gt;   &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;  &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;   &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1 4842        1     1      1     1       1     1     1     1     1     1     1\n2 4843        1     1      1     1       1     1     1     1     1     1     1\n3 4844        1     1      1     1       1     1     1     1     1     1     1\n4 4845        1     1      1     1       1    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA\n5 4847        1     1      1    NA      NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA\n6 4848        1     1      1     1      NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA\n\n\nThe resulting data frame above is a wide version of the orignal in which each station now has its own column. This is likely how we would record the data in the field!\nExample of Wide Format Data Let’s just use widefish for this since we just made it into wide format :)\n\nhead(widefish)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 12\n  fish  Release I80_1 Lisbon  Rstr Base_TD   BCE   BCW  BCE2  BCW2   MAE   MAW\n  &lt;fct&gt;   &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;  &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;   &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1 4842        1     1      1     1       1     1     1     1     1     1     1\n2 4843        1     1      1     1       1     1     1     1     1     1     1\n3 4844        1     1      1     1       1     1     1     1     1     1     1\n4 4845        1     1      1     1       1    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA\n5 4847        1     1      1    NA      NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA\n6 4848        1     1      1     1      NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA\n\n\nConverting from Wide to Long using pivot_longer (Tidyverse)\n\nlongfish&lt;- widefish %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(!fish, names_to = 'station', values_to = 'seen')\n\nhead(longfish)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  fish  station  seen\n  &lt;fct&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;int&gt;\n1 4842  Release     1\n2 4842  I80_1       1\n3 4842  Lisbon      1\n4 4842  Rstr        1\n5 4842  Base_TD     1\n6 4842  BCE         1\n\n\nAnd now we are back to our original data frame! The ‘!fish’ means simply that we do not wish to pivot the fish column. It remains unchanged. A ‘!’ before something in code usually means to exclude or remove. We’ve used names_to and values_to to give names to our new columns. pivot_longer will look for facotrs and put those in the names_to column and it will look for values (numeric) to pupt in the values_to column.\nNOTES There are MANY other ways to modify pivot_wider() and pivot_longer(). I encourage you to look in the help tab, the tidyR/ Tidyverse documentation online, and for other examples on google and stack overflow.\n\n:::"

This is something you’ll almost certainly be doing at some point for graphs and statistics! Pipes make this pretty easy.\nWhen thinking about scientific hypotheses and data analysis, we often consider how groups or populations vary (both within the group and between groups). As such, a simple statistical analysis that is common is called analysis of variance (ANOVA). We often also use linear models to assess differences between groups. We will get into statistical theory later, but this does mean that it is often meaningful to graph population and group level means (with error) for the sake of comparison. So let’s learn how to calculate those!\nThere are three steps: 1.) Manipulate the data as needed (correct format, select what you need, filter if necessary, etc)\n2.) Group the data as needed (so R know how to calculate the averages)\n3.) Do your calculatiuons!\nHere’s what that looks like in code form:\nLet’s use mtcars and calculate the mean miles per gallon (mpg) of cars by cylinder.\n\nmpgpercyl&lt;-mtcars%&gt;%\n  group_by(cyl)%&gt;% #group = cylinder \n  summarize(mean=mean(mpg),error=sd(mpg)) # a simple summarize with just mean and standard deviation\n\nhead(mpgpercyl)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n    cyl  mean error\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     4  26.7  4.51\n2     6  19.7  1.45\n3     8  15.1  2.56\n\n\nNow, maybe we want something more complex. Let’s say we want to look only at 4 cylinder cars that have more than 100 horsepower. Then we want to see the min, max, and mean mpg in addition to some error.\n\nmpgdf&lt;-mtcars%&gt;%\n  filter(cyl=='4' , hp &gt;100) %&gt;% #filters mtcars to only include cars w/ 4 cylinders and hp greater than 100\n  summarize(min = min(mpg), max = max(mpg), mean = mean(mpg), error=sd(mpg))\n\nhead(mpgdf)\n\n   min  max mean    error\n1 21.4 30.4 25.9 6.363961\n\n\nLet’s do one more using penguins. This time, I want to know how bill length various between species, islands, and sex. I also prefer to use standard error of the mean in my error bars over standard deviation. So I want to calculate that in my summarize function.\n\nhead(penguins)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 8\n  species island    bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_l…¹ body_…² sex    year\n  &lt;fct&gt;   &lt;fct&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;int&gt;   &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1 Adelie  Torgersen           39.1          18.7         181    3750 male   2007\n2 Adelie  Torgersen           39.5          17.4         186    3800 fema…  2007\n3 Adelie  Torgersen           40.3          18           195    3250 fema…  2007\n4 Adelie  Torgersen           NA            NA            NA      NA &lt;NA&gt;   2007\n5 Adelie  Torgersen           36.7          19.3         193    3450 fema…  2007\n6 Adelie  Torgersen           39.3          20.6         190    3650 male   2007\n# … with abbreviated variable names ¹​flipper_length_mm, ²​body_mass_g\n\nsumpens&lt;- penguins %&gt;%\n  group_by(species, island, sex) %&gt;%\n  summarize(meanbill=mean(bill_length_mm), sd=sd(bill_length_mm), n=n(), se=sd/sqrt(n))%&gt;%\n  na.omit() #removes rows with NA values (a few rows would otherwise have NA in 'sex' due to sampling error in the field)\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'species', 'island'.

Standard error cannot be calculated with a built in function in R (without packages that we aren’t using here) so I wrote the formula for it myself. Standard Error = standard deviation / squareroot(sample size) in other words: se=sd/sqrt(n)\nPS: here’s the payoff… we can use the dataframe we just made to build a really nice plot, like the one below. You will be learning ggplot next time! NOTE: this plot is about as complex as we’d ever expect you to get. So don’t worry, we aren’t starting with this kind of plot."

Do your calculatiuons!\nHere’s what that looks like in code form:\nLet’s use mtcars and calculate the mean miles per gallon (mpg) of cars by cylinder.\n\nmpgpercyl&lt;-mtcars%&gt;%\n  group_by(cyl)%&gt;% #group = cylinder \n  summarize(mean=mean(mpg),error=sd(mpg)) # a simple summarize with just mean and standard deviation\n\nhead(mpgpercyl)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n    cyl  mean error\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     4  26.7  4.51\n2     6  19.7  1.45\n3     8  15.1  2.56\n\n\nNow, maybe we want something more complex. Let’s say we want to look only at 4 cylinder cars that have more than 100 horsepower. Then we want to see the min, max, and mean mpg in addition to some error.\n\nmpgdf&lt;-mtcars%&gt;%\n  filter(cyl=='4' , hp &gt;100) %&gt;% #filters mtcars to only include cars w/ 4 cylinders and hp greater than 100\n  summarize(min = min(mpg), max = max(mpg), mean = mean(mpg), error=sd(mpg))\n\nhead(mpgdf)\n\n   min  max mean    error\n1 21.4 30.4 25.9 6.363961\n\n\nLet’s do one more using penguins. This time, I want to know how bill length various between species, islands, and sex. I also prefer to use standard error of the mean in my error bars over standard deviation. So I want to calculate that in my summarize function.\n\nhead(penguins)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 8\n  species island    bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_l…¹ body_…² sex    year\n  &lt;fct&gt;   &lt;fct&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;int&gt;   &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1 Adelie  Torgersen           39.1          18.7         181    3750 male   2007\n2 Adelie  Torgersen           39.5          17.4         186    3800 fema…  2007\n3 Adelie  Torgersen           40.3          18           195    3250 fema…  2007\n4 Adelie  Torgersen           NA            NA            NA      NA &lt;NA&gt;   2007\n5 Adelie  Torgersen           36.7          19.3         193    3450 fema…  2007\n6 Adelie  Torgersen           39.3          20.6         190    3650 male   2007\n# … with abbreviated variable names ¹​flipper_length_mm, ²​body_mass_g\n\nsumpens&lt;- penguins %&gt;%\n  group_by(species, island, sex) %&gt;%\n  summarize(meanbill=mean(bill_length_mm), sd=sd(bill_length_mm), n=n(), se=sd/sqrt(n))%&gt;%\n  na.omit() #removes rows with NA values (a few rows would otherwise have NA in 'sex' due to sampling error in the field)\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'species', 'island'.

    "text": "Change date column (factor) to date/time format\nTo do this we just need to recognize the order of or date/time. For example, we might have year, month, day, hours, minutes OR day, month, year, hours, minutes in order from left to right.\nIn this case we have: 07/01/2021 00:00:00 or month/day/year hours:minutes:seconds. We care about the order of these. So to simply, we have mdy_hms Lubridate has functions for all combinations of these formats. So, mdy_hms() is one. You may also have ymd_hm() or any other combo. You just enter your date info followed by an underscore and then your time info.

I have designed these resources for use in my 200 level Biostatistics course, 300 level Biology electives, and to teach my research students how to use R. That said, anyone who is trying to learn R (or learning how to teach R) may find these tutorials and excerises useful."
